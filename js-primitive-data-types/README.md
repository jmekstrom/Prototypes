## Javascript - Primitive Data Types

To get these files to your local machine you will need to do the following

1. Open your console to the proper directory
2. Type the following command:
	- `git checkout master` - This will switch you to your master branch
3. pull from the original Learningfuze repo
	- Use the following command:
		`git pull https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes.git master`
	- This will pull all the files from the original LearningFuze repo that you forked from, then merge the files with your existing files on your local machine.
4. Still in your console type the following: 
	- `git checkout -b js-primitive-data-types` press enter
	- This will create a new branch for this prototype

**NOTE:**
- When you commit and push your files to gitHub you need to push them to your new branch
- To do this do the following:
	- `git add . ` - To add the files
	- `git commit -m "Your message here"` - This commits the files and adds a message
	- `git push origin js-primitive-data-types` - This will push your files to gitHub on your new branch

### Getting Started

1. Make an index.html inside the `js-primitive-data-types` folder

2. Create a basic HTML DOM structure
	- DOCTYPE tag
	- HTML tag
	- head tag
	- body tag

3. Add `script` tags between your `head` tags

4. **DO NOT** edit this README file

## JS Functions

## Prototype - 1

### Create three variables inside your script tag
- Create a variable `firstName`, set it to your first name
- Create a variable `lastName`, set it to your last name
- create a variable `age`, set it to your age

### Use console.log
- Create a variable `output1`
	- Using your variables from above and concatenation create a string that resembles the below string example and store it in output1
	- String Example: "First name: Marry, Last name: Smith, Age: 57."
- Use `console.log()` in your script tag to log out your `output1` variable 

### Two more Variables
- Create two more variables 
	- Create a variable `x`, set it equal to any whole number between 1-100
	- Create a variable `y`, set it equal to any DIFFERENT whole number between 1-100

### Log out some more info
- Create three more output variables:
	- `output2`
	- `output3`
	- `output4`
- Set your output variables as follows:
- As an example I'll choose 12 and 55
	- output2 = the total of `x` and `y`
		- Example output: `67`
	- output3 = x and y concatenated 
		- Example output: `"1255"`
	- output4 = Text concatenated with the total of `x` and `y`
		- Example output: `"The total of x and y is 67"`

## After you have completed all the above

1. add, commit, and push your updated files to your js-primitive-data-types branch on gitHub
	- `git add . ` - To add the files
	- `git commit -m "Your message here"` - This commits the files and adds a message
	- `git push origin js-primitive-data-types` - This will push your files to gitHub on your new branch
2. Create a pull request
	- Title your pull request: `Your Name - js-primitive-data-types`
	- Make sure you are creating the pull request as follows:
	- In the image below make sure the numbered arrows match **YOUR** info
		- 1. Should be your branch name - Look down the list to find your branch
		- 2. Should be your Repo name - Look down the list to find your Repo
		- 3. Should be your js-primitive-data-types branch
	- If you are unsure on any of this or are unable to find your branch or repo, ask for help, don't just guess
	- This is important if you want feedback and credit for the prototypes
